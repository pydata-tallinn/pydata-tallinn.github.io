## What is PyData Tallinn?

It's a meetup group organized by two volunteers, [Isaac Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-chung/) and [Andreas Beger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasbeger/). 

We're a group with content by and for data professionals—[^1]people whose work revolves around data and models. Data analystis, data engineers, data scientists, ML engineers, AI engineers, etc. 

We both work in this area, and we simply want to see interesting, technical content. We don't sell anything, we don't make any money off of this. 

## Is this just about Python?

No. We care more about the "data" part of this. If you've got something in another language but that is relevant for people working with data and models 

## What's the format for talks? 

Talks are typically 20-30 minutes with Q&A afterwards, but we are open to alternative ideas. You can submit a proposal using our [speaker form](https://forms.gle/p67CDXR7pxzwRaa98). 

The topic is up to you. If you have some questions about it, tell us in the form and we'll get in touch. 

## I'm thinking about being a speaker, but I'm not sure...

If you're not sure, but thinking about it, (connect and) message us: [Isaac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-chung/), [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasbeger/). 

If giving a talk sounds daunting, that's ok! We can help you develop a topic and talk, and the confidence to present it. 

But I'm a (student|junior|etc): that's fine! Rome wasn't built in a day. And, (a): you probably know more than you think; (b) you don't have to be a world expert to talk about something interesting you learned, or found, or found difficult. 

## Do I need to be a ML Engineer, Data Scientist, etc. to attend?

No. If you think the kind of content we have might be interesting to you ([past events](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-tallinn/events/?type=past)), come check it out. 

## Will this help me learn about AI?

Yes and no. We do have some AI-ish[^2] content, but that's not what our group is about. 

## I'm from a company, can we sponsor you?

Yes! Let's collaborate on a future event. Minimally, you provide a small budget for food & drink and a speaker or two. Maybe the venue as well. We provide another one or two speakers, and a venue, if needed. 

Message us on LinkedIn if that sounds interesting: [Isaac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-chung/), [Andy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasbeger/). 

## I've got another question that isn't covered here
