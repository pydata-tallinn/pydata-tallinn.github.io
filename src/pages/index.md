## Welcome to PyData Tallinn!

A community for data professionals, meaning data analysts/engineers/scientists, BI analysts, ML engineers, MLOps, etc. Regardless of the language or tools used.

## Meetups

We try to organize quarterly meetups. The best way to find out about future events is to join our [meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/pydata-tallinn/). You'll get an email when we schedule new events. 

We are always looking for speakers. If you are interested in giving a future talk, workshop, or some other type of content, [submit at a proposal here](https://forms.gle/p67CDXR7pxzwRaa98) ([more info](faq#whats-the-format-for-talks)).

## Official Stuff

We are a chapter of PyData. PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. The PyData community provides a forum where users and developers can exchange ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

The NumFOCUS Code of Conduct governs this meetup. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the Code of Conduct, please contact the organizers.
